## About Project: 
Creating a Working Prototype for Room Booking System for UOW.

### User Role:
1. User Admin
   User administrator will be allowed  to :
   1) create accounts in the system, 
   2) manage the accounts thereafter, and 
   3) viewing the activity history (when was last login and logout) of the account. 
   
   Note: A user administrator role is a UOW staff but cannot take on any other roles (i.e. cannot be a normal staff user or
   student user).
   
2. Staff
   Staff will be allowed to:
   1) create a room, 
   2) launch a room (make available for reservations of a newly created room), 
   3) adjust the price (each booking is chargeable), date/time, promotional codes, and capacity of room.

3. Student
   Student will be allowed to:
   1) view the list of rooms available, 
   2) make a booking of one or more rooms, 
   3) modify an existing booking and 
   4) cancel an existing booking.

### Technologies used:
* **Next.js**    
  Next.js is an open-source React front-end development web framework that enables 
  functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications. 
* **Bootstrap**   
  Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. 
  It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
* **Strapi**   
  Strapi is an open-source Node.js based, Headless CMS that saves developers a lot of development time while giving them the 
  freedom to use their favorite tools and frameworks. Strapi also enables content editors to streamline content delivery 
  (text, images, video, etc) across any devices.
* **GraphQL**   
  GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides 
  a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they 
  need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
* **SQLLite**   
  SQLite allows a single database connection to access multiple database files simultaneously. This brings many nice features 
  like joining tables in different databases or copying data between databases in a single command. SQLite is capable of 
  creating in-memory databases that are very fast to work with.
